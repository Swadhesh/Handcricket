 This repository consists of the traditional handcrciket game played in our childhood.
 
It's a two player game where the alternate being a batsman and a bowler. Who decides to do what is initially determined by a toss.

The one who wins the toss chooses to either be the batsman or the bowler.

Both the batsman and the bowler keeps selecting a number randomly.

The numbers here is considered as the runs and are added to the batsman's score.

If both the computer and the user chooses the same number then the batsman is considered to be out and his score would be the target for the next batsman.
